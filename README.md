# Welcome
I'm @BigMacAdmin on the MacAdmins Slack

I do full stack IT for small businesses. Repositories owned by this account are purely personal/convenience stuff at this time.

Any of my work projects that are fit to share will be found at: [https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting).
