# Welcome
I'm @BigMacAdmin on the MacAdmins Slack

I do full stack IT for small businesses. Repositories owned by this account are purely personal/convenience stuff at this time.

Any of my professional projects that are fit to share will be found at: [https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting). 

I'm the author of [Renew](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting/Renew), which is a zsh script solution for gently (or not so much) urging your users to restart their workstations on a regular basis and [Baseline](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting/Baseline) - an MDM agnostic Zero-Touch solution for macOS workstation setup.

I've also released some other scripts I use in my day to day that Mac Admins may find useful or interesting [here.](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting/macOS-Scripts)
